Python Code Documentation:

The Python code establishes a connection with an Arduino board to receive angle and distance data. Functions open_serial_port and close_serial_port are used to initialize this connection. The code utilizes Numpy and Matplotlib, popular python libraries, to create polar plot to visualize the detected object’s position. Polar plot is created with create_polar_plot function, and it is later dynamically updated  with update_plot function to reflect the changing positions as data is received from Arduino. The plot shows distance markers on radial lines corresponding to different angles. It also includes features like grid lines, markers, and a sweeping arm. The code also optimizes plot’s size and window position. The main loop continuously reads data from the serial port and updates the plot accordingly. It ensures program termination upon user interruption or window closure. Overall, the Python code creates a radar-like plot design, which gets updated with real time data. For more detailed code explanation, you can refer to the actual Python code with line-by-line documentation above.
