Arduino Code Documentation:


Before void setup, we are initializing values which will be useful in the code afterwards. In void setup, we define trigger and echo pin as output and input, because we give the trigger pin a signal and we get a signal from echo pin. Writing Serial.begin helps us to see values in Serial Monitor. Then we initialize the servo motor. Void loop can be divided into two parts. One servo motor going from 0 to 180 degrees and second part when servo motor is coming back from 180 to 0 degrees. Each for loop has same content. First three lines, moves servo and calculated distance with ultrasonic sensor. Third line calls another function which is responsible for the calculation. Last three lines are there to print out the information in Serial Monitor. As for caluclateDistance function, we sent signal with trigger pin and receive time of signal returning in echo pin. After that we calculate distance by multiplying it with velocity of sound (Distance = Time * Velocity).
